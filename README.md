# 436 (Purplexity) Robot Code

created using finite state machines (courtesy of purplelib) and yagsl

## notes
 - currently, swerve config is taken straight from src/main/deploy/swerve/maxSwerve in https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example
 - need to check if invertedIMU in src/main/deploy/swerve/swervedrive.json should be set to true or not
 - need to figure out correct configuration for yagsl
 - need to tune pid :/
